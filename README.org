#+TITLE: CHIP-8 Interpreter

this is my first time using nim so i dont expect it to be amazing

it depends on having sdl2, so have that installed i guess

to build, use:

#+begin_src sh
  nimble build -d:release
#+end_src

to run, use:

#+begin_src sh
  chip8 (FILENAME)
#+end_src

if there is no filename, then it will attempt to run the default test rom
included in the submodule
